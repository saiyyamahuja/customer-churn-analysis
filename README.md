# Jio Internship – Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains my work during my internship at **Jio India**, focusing on **predicting customer churn** using advanced machine learning techniques.
The project includes **exploratory data analysis**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, and **evaluation**—all implemented in Jupyter notebooks.

## 📌 Project Overview

Telecom companies face significant revenue losses due to customer churn. This project aims to:

* Analyze customer data
* Identify key factors influencing churn
* Build predictive models to identify at-risk customers
* Provide actionable insights to improve customer retention
